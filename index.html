		        <h1>Dynamic College Admissions and the Determinants of Students' College Persistence</h1>
			<p style="font-size:1.45rem">We analyze the determinants of students’ college persistence in the context of dynamic
				centralized assignment mechanisms, where students can learn about their preferences and
				abilities over time and can re-apply to the system. We show that the most common as-
				signment mechanism, the Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm, can result in significant
				inefficiencies as it fails to elicit the intensity on students’ preferences. Using data from Chile,
				we provide empirical evidence of these inefficiencies. In particular, we show that not being
				assigned to your top-reported preference has a positive causal effect on the probability of (i)
				reapplying to the centralized system, (ii) switching your major/college, and (iii) delaying your
				college graduation. Moreover, we show that a significant fraction of students change their
				preferences over time, which also increases switchings and delay graduations. With these
				empirical facts, we build and estimate a structural model of students’ college progression in
				the presence of a centralized admission system, allowing students to learn over time their
				match-quality. We use the estimated model to disentangle how much of students’ switching
				behavior is due to initial mismatches, as opposed to students’ learning over time about their
				match-quality. Finally, we analyze the impact of changing the assignment mechanism and
				the application rules on the efficiency of the college admissions’ system.

			<h1>Do “short-list” students report truthfully?</h1>
			<p style="font-size:1.45rem">We analyze the application process in the Chilean College Admissions problem. Students
				can submit up to 10 preferences, but most students do not fill their entire application list
				("short-list"). Even though students face no incentives to misreport, we find evidence of
				strategic behavior as students tend to omit programs for which their admission probabilities
				are too low. To rationalize this behavior, we construct a portfolio problem where students
				maximize their expected utility given their preferences and beliefs over admission probabilities.
				We adapt the estimation procedure proposed by Agarwal and Somaini (2018) to solve
				a large portfolio problem. To simplify this task, we show that it is suficient to compare a
				ROL with only a subset of ROLs ("one-shot swaps") to ensure its optimality without running
				into the curse of dimensionality. To better identify the model, we exploit a unique
				exogenous variation on the admission weights over time. We find that assuming truth-telling
				leads to biased results. Specifically, when students only include programs if it is strictly
				profitable to do so, assuming truth-telling underestimates how preferred selective programs
				are and overstates the value of being unassigned and the degree of preference heterogeneity
				in the system. Ignoring the constraint on the length of the list can also result in biased
				estimates, even if the proportion of constrained ROLs is relatively small. Our estimation
				results strongly suggest that "short-list" students should not be interpreted as truth-tellers,
				even in a seemingly strategy-proof environment. Finally, we apply our estimation method to
				estimate students' preferences for programs and majors in Chile and find strong differences
				in preferences regarding students' gender and scores.</p>

				<h1>Improving the Chilean College Admissions System</h1>
				<p style="font-size:1.45rem">In this paper we present the design and implementation of a new system to solve the Chilean college
					admissions problem. We develop an algorithm that obtains all stable allocations when preferences are not
					strict and when all tied students in the last seat of a program (if any) must be allocated, and we used this
					algorithm to determine which mechanism was used to perform the allocation. In addition, we propose a
					new method to incorporate the affirmative action that is part of the system and correct the inefficiencies
					that arise from having double-assigned students. By unifying the regular admission with the affirmative
					action, we have improved the allocation of approximately 3% of students every year since 2016. From a
					theoretical standpoint, we introduce a new concept of stability and we show that some desired properties,
					such as strategy-proofness and monotonicity, cannot be guaranteed under 
					flexible quotas. Nevertheless, we
					show that the mechanism is strategy-proof in the large, and therefore truthful reporting is approximately
					optimal.</p>

				<h1>College admissions problem with ties and flexible quotas.</h1>
				<p style="font-size:1.45rem">We study an extension of the classical college admission problem where applicants have strict preferences but careers may include ties in their preference lists. 
					We present an algorithm which enables us to find stable assignments without breaking ties rules, but considering flexible quotas. 
					We investigate the properties of this algorithm -- stability, optimality -- and we show that the resulting algorithm is neither monotone nor strategy-proof. 
					The mechanism is used to solve real instances of the Chilean college admission problem. Among our results, 
					we show that the welfare of students is increased if flexible quotas and a student-optimal assignment are combined. 
					Finally, we argue why such assignment may be desirable in the Chilean context. </p>

			<h1>Effect of Including High-School Grades Rank in the Admission Process to Chilean Universities</h1>
			<p style="font-size:1.45rem">This paper analyses the effect of including high school grade rankings as a new factor in the admission process
				to Chilean universities. The paper evaluates the impact of different weighting strategies of the high school grade
				ranking and identifies socioeconomic and gender characteristics of the students who were benefited and harmed by
				the inclusion of this new factor. Starting with the weightings of the different factors considered in the Admission
				Process for 2012, we simulate, using a selection algorithm, alternative weightings for high school grade rankings
				in the 2013 Admission Process. We also evaluate the effect of the actual increase in the weighting of grade ranking
				in the 2014 admission process. Even though the impact on students' entrance and exit from the selection list 
				is rather small, the introduction of the high school grade ranking into the admission process has an effect on 
				the composition of the students selected, producing greater socioeconomic and gender equality.</p>

			<h1>Hunter-gatherers maintain assortativity in cooperation despite high-levels of residential change and mixing.</h1>
			<p style="font-size:1.45rem">Widespread cooperation is a defining feature of human societies from hunter-gatherer bands to nation states , 
				but explaining its evolution remains a challenge. Although positive assortment of cooperators is recognized as a basic requirement 
				for the evolution of cooperation, the mechanisms governing assortment are debated. Moreover, the social structure of modern
				huntergatherers, characterized by high mobility, residential mixing, and low genetic relatedness, undermines assortment and adds
				to the puzzle of how cooperation evolved. Here, we analyze four years of data (2010, 2013, 2014, 2016) tracking residence and 
				levels of cooperation elicited from a public goods game in Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania. Data were collected from 56 camps, 
				comprising 383 unique individuals, 137 of whom we have data for two or more years. Despite significant residential mixing, 
				we observe a robust pattern of assortment that is necessary for cooperation to evolve; in every year, Hadza camps exhibit high 
				between-camp and low within-camp variation in cooperation. We find little evidence that cooperative behavior within individuals
				is stable over time or that similarity in cooperation between dyads predicts their future cohabitation. Both sets of findings are
				inconsistent with models that assume stable cooperative and selfish types, including partner choice models. Consistent with social
				norms, culture, and reciprocity theories, the strongest predictor of an individual’s level of cooperation is the mean cooperation of
				their current campmates. These findings underscore the adaptive nature of human cooperation—particularly its responsiveness to social
				contexts—as a feature that is important in generating the assortment necessary for cooperation to evolve.</p>
