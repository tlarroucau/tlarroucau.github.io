					that the most common assignment mechanism, the Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm, can result

					collect novel data about students’ preferences, their beliefs on admission chances, and their 
					college outcomes for the Chilean college system. We analyze two main behavioral channels that 
					explain students’ dynamic decisions. First, by exploiting discontinuities on admission cutoffs,
					we show that not being assigned to ones’ top-reported preference has a positive causal effect
					on the probability of re-applying to the centralized system and switching one’s major/college, 
					suggesting that students switch to more preferred programs due to initial mismatches. Second, 
					we find that a significant fraction of students change their preferences during their college
					progression, and that these changes are correlated with their grades, suggesting that students 
					may learn about their match-quality. Based on these facts, we build and estimate a structural 
					model of students’ college progression in the presence of a centralized admission system, allowing 
					students to learn about their match-quality over time and re-apply to the system. We use the 
					estimated model to disentangle how much of students’ switching behavior is due to initial mismatches
					and learning, and we analyze the impact of changing the assignment mechanism and the re-application
					rules on the efficiency of the system. Our counterfactual results show that policies that provide
					score bonuses that elicit information on students’ cardinal preferences and leverage dynamic

					<h1>Do “short-list” students report truthfully?</h1>
					</div>
			<div class="paper">
			<div class="popuptext">
			<p>We analyze the application process in the Chilean College Admissions problem. Students
				can submit up to 10 preferences, but most students do not fill their entire application list
				("short-list"). Even though students face no incentives to misreport, we find evidence of
				strategic behavior as students tend to omit programs for which their admission probabilities
				are too low. To rationalize this behavior, we construct a portfolio problem where students
				maximize their expected utility given their preferences and beliefs over admission probabilities.
				We adapt the estimation procedure proposed by Agarwal and Somaini (2018) to solve
				a large portfolio problem. To simplify this task, we show that it is suficient to compare a
				ROL with only a subset of ROLs ("one-shot swaps") to ensure its optimality without running
				into the curse of dimensionality. To better identify the model, we exploit a unique
				exogenous variation on the admission weights over time. We find that assuming truth-telling
				leads to biased results. Specifically, when students only include programs if it is strictly
				profitable to do so, assuming truth-telling underestimates how preferred selective programs
				are and overstates the value of being unassigned and the degree of preference heterogeneity
				in the system. Ignoring the constraint on the length of the list can also result in biased
				estimates, even if the proportion of constrained ROLs is relatively small. Our estimation
				results strongly suggest that "short-list" students should not be interpreted as truth-tellers,
				even in a seemingly strategy-proof environment. Finally, we apply our estimation method to
				estimate students' preferences for programs and majors in Chile and find strong differences
				in preferences regarding students' gender and scores.</p>

<p>In this paper we present the design and implementation of a new system to solve the Chilean college
	admissions problem. We develop an algorithm that obtains all stable allocations when preferences are not
	strict and when all tied students in the last seat of a program (if any) must be allocated, and we used this
	algorithm to determine which mechanism was used to perform the allocation. In addition, we propose a
	new method to incorporate the affirmative action that is part of the system and correct the inefficiencies
	that arise from having double-assigned students. By unifying the regular admission with the affirmative
	action, we have improved the allocation of approximately 3% of students every year since 2016. From a
	theoretical standpoint, we introduce a new concept of stability and we show that some desired properties,
	such as strategy-proofness and monotonicity, cannot be guaranteed under
	flexible quotas. Nevertheless, we
	show that the mechanism is strategy-proof in the large, and therefore truthful reporting is approximately
	optimal.</p>

			<div class="paper">
			<div class="aaa popuptext">
			<p >This paper analyses the effect of including high school grade rankings as a new factor in the admission process
				to Chilean universities. The paper evaluates the impact of different weighting strategies of the high school grade
				ranking and identifies socioeconomic and gender characteristics of the students who were benefited and harmed by
				the inclusion of this new factor. Starting with the weightings of the different factors considered in the Admission
				Process for 2012, we simulate, using a selection algorithm, alternative weightings for high school grade rankings
				in the 2013 Admission Process. We also evaluate the effect of the actual increase in the weighting of grade ranking
				in the 2014 admission process. Even though the impact on students' entrance and exit from the selection list
				is rather small, the introduction of the high school grade ranking into the admission process has an effect on
				the composition of the students selected, producing greater socioeconomic and gender equality.</p>

					<h1>Hunter-gatherers maintain assortativity in cooperation despite high-levels of residential change and mixing.</h1>

			<div class="paper">
			<div class="popuptext">
			<p>Widespread cooperation is a defining feature of human societies from hunter-gatherer bands to nation states ,
				but explaining its evolution remains a challenge. Although positive assortment of cooperators is recognized as a basic requirement
				for the evolution of cooperation, the mechanisms governing assortment are debated. Moreover, the social structure of modern
				huntergatherers, characterized by high mobility, residential mixing, and low genetic relatedness, undermines assortment and adds
				to the puzzle of how cooperation evolved. Here, we analyze four years of data (2010, 2013, 2014, 2016) tracking residence and
				levels of cooperation elicited from a public goods game in Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania. Data were collected from 56 camps,
				comprising 383 unique individuals, 137 of whom we have data for two or more years. Despite significant residential mixing,
				we observe a robust pattern of assortment that is necessary for cooperation to evolve; in every year, Hadza camps exhibit high
				between-camp and low within-camp variation in cooperation. We find little evidence that cooperative behavior within individuals
				is stable over time or that similarity in cooperation between dyads predicts their future cohabitation. Both sets of findings are
				inconsistent with models that assume stable cooperative and selfish types, including partner choice models. Consistent with social
				norms, culture, and reciprocity theories, the strongest predictor of an individual’s level of cooperation is the mean cooperation of
				their current campmates. These findings underscore the adaptive nature of human cooperation—particularly its responsiveness to social
				contexts—as a feature that is important in generating the assortment necessary for cooperation to evolve.</p>
